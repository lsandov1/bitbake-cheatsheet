* Metadata Syntax
** Comments

Must start on the first column unless these are part of shell/python functions

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# this is a valid comment
    # this is an invalid comment because it does not stat at first column
HELLO = "WORLD" # this is another valid comment because it is after metadata


foo() {
    # this is a valid comment and can start at any column (as in shell)
    echo "foo" # this is also valid (as in shell)
}

python bar() {
    # this is a valid comment and can start at any column (as in python)
    print("bar") # this is also valid (as in python)
}
#+END_EXAMPLE
